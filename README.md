Here is my React App that I did just to make some more practice with gained knowledge from tutorials!

## 🕵🏻 How it works:
We input city name like Warsaw or Paris, then app is trying to get city geolocation (latitude and longitude) and finally we are putting that data into API url to recieve weather current weather information from that region! 

## Data is taken from free Weather API

## How it looks:

#### yes, visually I was aiming for a similar look to the default weather app on IOS

Cooool 😎
